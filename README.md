The solubility of various organic molecules is an important property in Drug discovery, design and development .The drug likeness property of a molecule is depends on
how easily it can dissolve and reach its target in the body, and solubility plays a big part in that!
Synthesizing compounds for potential drugs can be both time consuming and expensive, only to find out that the molecule is not compatible in terms of solubility! 
The following application tries to solve this issue building utilising machine learning to predict the solubility value of the molecule, along with some other parameters 
like log of partion cofficient between water and octanol (LogP), molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds and aromatic proportion. It needs the structure of the 
molecule in one dimensional form (SMILES notation) and returns the above values !
